# Linux Features for Safety-Critical Systems (LFSCS)
The ELISA Linux Features for Safety-Critical Systems (LFSCS) WG investigates Linux kernel features which may be leveraged for use in safety critical systems.  We aim to bring together kernel developers and producers of safety critical systems to enable use of such features in real systems, and to learn from these experiences together as a community.
This repository will contain the peer-reviewed materials produced by and for this group.  Additional collaborative work-in-progress (topic suggestions, notes, etc.) in the project [wiki](https://github.com/coppermanME/wg-LFSCS/blob/main/wiki).
